# mlb-hit-predictions

This is the repository for a small statistics project I'm working on.
I intend to choose the MLB player who is most likely to get a hit on any given day.

2019.csv contains play by play data for every play from the 2019 MLB season.
2010s.csv contains the same data but for the entire previous decade.
The data from retrosheet was compiled using their DOS tool and play files.

The best way to run the code is to clone the whole repository and open it as a project in RStudio. Initially running the program could take some time since the data is compiled from a few sources.
